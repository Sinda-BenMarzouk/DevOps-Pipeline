# Application for Software Testing & DevOps Pipeline
A simple python application used to demonstrate the examples of the 4 types of software testing and implemented through the CI/CD pipeline.

## Application Description

- The user can add an item to the todo list, then this item can be deleted or updated.
- We used sqlite3 for the database. The method "db.create_all" creates a database with all the tables we specified (in our case, only Note)
- We used Flask for the web development.
