# Application for Software Testing & DevOps Pipeline
A CRUD python application used to demonstrate the examples of the 4 types of software testing and implemented through the CI/CD pipeline.

## Application Description

- The user can create, read, update or delete a note from the todo list.
- We used sqlite3 for the database, initialised in database.py which contains the tables we specified (in our case, only Note)
- We used Flask for the web development.

Here's a video demonstrating the possible functionalities of our application :
